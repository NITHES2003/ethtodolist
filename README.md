# TodoList
The objective of this capstone Ethereum Decentralized application project is to create a web3
application that enables users to share daily tasks to be completed and that will be saved in a
blockchain. The blockchain part of this application can also be understood as a database. By
keeping such a list, we make sure that our tasks are added down all in one place so we don't
forget anything important. And by prioritizing tasks, we plan the order in which we'll do
them, so that we can tell what needs our immediate attention, and what we can leave until
later.

We are using Smart Contracts and subsequent web application uses Html, CSS and
JavaScript in this project. The analysis part is focusing on the different and new technologies
that can achieve the major goal of creating a decentralized application and contains
information about the tools that have been chosen to complete it. We first focus on features
that will be implement, then we work on the simple user interface design.
The software development model adopted is the incremental one. I have been able to
determine problems with the code, the functionalities and the connectivity between the
application and the blockchain network.
